                <h1>Aikido</h1>
                <p>
                    Aikido is a modern way of self defense, created by Morihei Ueshiba.<br />
                    Aikido's goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselfes,
                    while also protecting from injury (by the protector).<br />
                    The main focuss of Aikido on techniques, without using any (extra) strength. Quite on the contrary.<br />
                    When using excess strength to make up for any mistake in the technique, the technique will simply
                    fail altogether!

                <h1>Playing Keyboard</h1>
                <p>
                    Although I do frequently play the keyboard of my computer, I also grew up in quite a musical
                    family.<br />
                    This most likely helped me start playing an instrument, with my preference to the same instrument
                    my dad plays: The keyboard.<br /><br />
                    Besides lessons, I also used to participate in an anual event at the end of the year, called "Rock
                    & Loll".<br />
                    It consisting of a bunch of musicians with a love for their instrument coming together, along with
                    a list of songs they want to play
                    around a specific theme,
                    and putting together a small band for each song that ultimately gets played after a selection.<br /><br />
                    I've participated 3 times, and really miss being unable to participate due to me living on my own
                    in a different city as of writing.
